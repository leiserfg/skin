Skin is a project template (something like PasteScript but without Paste itself) powered by Jinja2 and a lot of needs of something like it.
I marge here the best I see in mr.bob and marek and use some lines (actually a lot) of Voodoo.

Installing
==========

Install jinja2 >= 2.7 and colorama >= 0.2.5
